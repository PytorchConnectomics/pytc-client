# PyTC Client

A desktop client that interacts with the `pytorch_connectomics` library for connectomics workflows.

This file only contains instructions on running the application. For a high-level description of the project structure, see `project-structure.md`.

## Set-up

### 1. Bootstrap

```bash
scripts/bootstrap.sh      # macOS / Linux
scripts\bootstrap.ps1     # Windows
```
Re-run this only when you need to update dependencies.

### 2. Launch the full stack

```bash
scripts/start.sh          # macOS / Linux
scripts\start.ps1         # Windows
```

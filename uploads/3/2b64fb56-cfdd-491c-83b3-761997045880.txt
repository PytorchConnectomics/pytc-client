In the nation wide University Entrance Exam of year 2002, I scored 649 out of 750, which is the 2nd place in my high school (670 graduates/year), which is the 2nd best high school in Fuzhou, my hometown in Fuzhou. I was awarded the scholarship for graduate from my high school and the scholarship for new student from my college for this achievement.
